the language is like a tree. everything slowly unfolds from its roots. every word for instance begins with the broadest block and slowly explains itself using other blocks. while there may be very few root words, this tree method is like narrowing a search using more and more tags, there are only so many results when you have 5-6 blocks, if you even need that many. order is important, especially in the first couple blocks `[dirt].[soul]` translates into english as soul of the dirt, or mother nature. spoken in the other order `[soul].[dirt]` translates into english as a dirty soul, or a grounded soul, maybe someone in tune with nature. because of this modularity, every block can be a noun, adjective, or verb.

all blocks are constructed from one consonant and one vowel. silence can be used in place of a consonant and vowel, presenting the very literal meaning to other sound in the block, as sounds have meaning themselvves and blocks are technically conjugations. for instance, the sound r' means soul. spoken with a vowel it can mean a couple different things, such as the body the soul inhabits, the blood that courses through it, the energy it posseses, etc.. but spoken as just r' it means soul in the broadest terms. this can be applied to vowels as well, which are representatives of raw emotion. for instace, 'u, which is the vowel for apathy, spoken by itself literally means apathetic, or the numbing of emotion, black or invisible energy.

conjugations shouldnt be nested in the unfolding of the block tree. all words must unfold one block at a time to narrow its meaning, and that block should only derive its context from the blocks before it. words should be as efficient as possible. if `[tool].[vessel]` means bottle/flask and `[lifeblood].[pond]` means water, that doesnt mean you need to say `[tool].[vessel].[lifeblood].[pond]` to mean water bottle. that is called chunking, where large chunks of blocks are used as single blocks.

"water bottle" would be spoken as so with chunking

    {-[tool].[vessel]-}.{-[lifeblood].[pond]-} : {bottle}.{water}

while chunking is possible, and used in very few edge cases by the native speakers, it is not how the language is meant to be spoken

"watter bottle" would be better spoken as

    [vessel].[pond]

there arent any other obvious cases of putting a pond in a vessel, and you should only need to be specific if the object you are meaning to describe is not obvious. an easy way to make sure your word is relatively efficient is to speak the english counterparts of each block with the phrase "of" or "of the" in between. for instance a rabbit hole might be `[mouth].[dirt]` aka "mouth of dirt". dust might be `[dirt].[wind]` or "dirt of wind"

numbers are a common example of chunking, as its pretty necesarry to convey specific amounts. the number system is spoken as so

    {-[place].[value]-}..

if you need to speak the number 243, you would speak it as such

    {-[100].[2]-}.{-[10].[4]-}.{-[null].[3]-}
