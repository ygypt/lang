# tree creature lang

i will be slowly bringing my work to this github, cuz its kinda all over the place rn so i wanna collect it into one spot.

flora will have these ancient creatures who no longer inhabit the world but their writings still mark the trees they burrowed

+ lang.txt has all the technical info on the language
  + its in txt format so it doesnt automatically wrap text on github, youll have to put it in notepad and turn on "wrap text" if u wanna read it like a normal person
+ sounds.txt has every possible block you can make with each consonant and vowel
+ words.txt is a buncha words they may use
  + i will soon add a blocks.txt which will be where ill connect words and sounds to make the first basic dictionary
