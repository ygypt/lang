# tree creature lang

i will be slowly bringing my work to this github, cuz its kinda all over the place rn so i wanna collect it into one spot.

flora will have these ancient creatures who no longer inhabit the world but their writings still mark the trees they burrowed

the language has a small set of consonants and vowels, each with their own meanings. combining a single consonant with a single vowel creates what is called a block. every possible block has a designanted word that has many literal and metaphorical meanings

words can be conjugated from these small blocks to mean more specific things. this shouldnt always be necessary.. the native speakers of the language spoke with efficiency and elegance, getting their point across with as few words consisting of as few blocks as possible. often times entire sentences are just a couple single-block words, open to interperetation by the listener/reader

their written (or rather clawed) language represents this simplicity rather well. there are 5 vowel symbols, one of which is carved with the bottom claw to denote the vowel of that block, and 3 unique markings atop the vowel symbol to indicate the consonant.

the language can be written in any direction, but it is historically written from bottom right to top left in a spiral around a tree going up, as the story branches out with the physical branches of the tree. modern scholars typically work with the language right to left, top to bottom, to directly compare the old writing with the english translation, but purists tend to go right to left, bottom to top
