# tree creature lang
#### i am not a linguist
i will be slowly bringing my work to this github, cuz its kinda all over the place rn so i wanna collect it into one spot.

flora will have these ancient creatures who no longer inhabit the world but their writings still mark the trees they burrowed

+ lang.md has all the technical info on the language
  + it will be split into smaller more focused bits later
+ sounds.md has every possible sound you can make
  + gonna be trimmed down as i dont intend to use alot of consonants
+ blocks.md is all possible blocks; a combination of one consonant followed by one vowel
+ words.md is a buncha words they may use
+ i will soon add a lex.md which will be where ill connect words and blocks to make the first basic dictionary
