+simple vocabulary, complex grammar
  + squeeze as much mileage as i can out of
the small set of blocks
  + complex grammar doesnt mean a thousand case
markers and genders and crap, it means there is
a wide variety of tactics that each marker can employ.
    + if its impossible to be grammatically correct,
then the markers have been maximised
