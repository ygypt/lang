## how to make thought

you can kinda just use the words however you like.
its a very personal and interpereted language.
imagine if the shouts from skyrim was a whole language.
there are some fundamentals that the native species
commonly used, but it differered tree to tree, and
high level grammar is lost to time and in translations.
scholars have pieced together what they could and this
is what theyve found.. but the language is not meant to
follow a specific order.

change.joy topic.friend vessel.water

##### noun prefix
to : topic

##### verb prefix
no : not
pa : past tense
qe : equivalent

##### relationals
relationals are the basic blocks that turn
words into verbial sentences

sentences are naturally first person but a topic
marker can be prefixed to any word in the sentence
to notate it as the subject/topic

```
xe existence
xe   : i exist
xeno : i dont exist
reqe xa   : i am equal to ko
repa xa   : i was ko
reqepa xa : i was equal to xa
re
```
