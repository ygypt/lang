## how to make thought

##### relationals
relationals are the basic blocks that turn
words into verbial sentences

for these examples, i will be using placeholders
as the exact blocks havent beenworked out


`ko, ka, ku, ke, ki` will all be nouns used for
exampling purposes

sentences are naturally first person but a topic
marker `to` can be prefixed to any word in the
sentence to notate it as the subject/topic

```
xe existence (x is y)

xeko          : ko exists
xeko ka       : ko is ka

variants
after verb block, before root
no : negative
pa : past tense
qe : equivalence

var examples
xeqeko ka : ko is equal to ka
xenoko : ko doesnt exist
xeqepako ka : ko was equal to ka
xeqepanoko ka : ko wasnt equal to ka

ca causation (x caused y to z)
the block ca is the actor prefix

xeko caku : ku caused ko to exist
xeko ka caku : ku caused ko to be ka
```
