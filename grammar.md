## how to make thought

##### relationals
relationals are the basic blocks that turn
words into verbial sentences

for these examples, i will be using placeholders
as the exact blocks havent beenworked out

```
particles
after verb block, before root
no : negative
pa : past tense
fu : future tense
vo : volition
qe : equivalence
```

`ko, ka, ku, ke, ki` will all be nouns used for
exampling purposes

```
xe existence (x is y)

xeko          : ko exists
xeko ka       : ko is ka
```
```
ca causation (x caused y)
the block ca is the actor prefix

xeko caku    : ku caused ko to exist
xeko ka caku : ku caused ko to be ka
```
```
sa has (x has y)

sako ka : ko has ka
```
