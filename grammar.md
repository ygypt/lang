## how to make thought

##### relationals
relationals are the basic blocks that turn
words into verbial sentences

for these examples, i will be using placeholders
as the exact blocks havent beenworked out


`ko, ka, ku, ke, ki` will all be nouns used for
exampling purposes

sentences are naturally first person but a topic
marker `to` can be prefixed to any word in the
sentence to notate it as the subject/topic

```
xe existence

xe toko          : ko exists
xe toko ka       : ko is ka
xe toko qeka     : ko is equal to ka

xeno toko        : ko doesnt exist
xeno toko ka     : ko is not ka
xeno toko qeka   : ko is not equal to ka

xepa toko        : ko did exist
xepa toko ka     : ko was ka
xepa toko qeka   : ko was equal to ka

xenopa toko      : ko didnt existed
xenopa toko ka   : ko wasnt ka
xenopa toko qeka : ko wasnt equal to ka

ce change

ce toko : ko now exists (became exist)
ce toko ka : ko is now ka
```
