## how to make thought

you can kinda just use the words however you like.
its a very personal and interpereted language.
imagine if the shouts from skyrim was a whole language.
there are some fundamentals that the native species
commonly used, but it differered tree to tree, and
high level grammar is lost to time and in translations.
scholars have pieced together what they could and this
is what theyve found.. but the language is not meant to
follow a specific order.
