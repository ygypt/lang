## how to make thought

##### relationals
relationals are the basic blocks that turn
words into verbial sentences

for these examples, i will be using placeholders
as the exact blocks havent beenworked out


`ko, ka, ku, ke, ki` will all be nouns used for
exampling purposes

sentences are naturally first person but a topic
marker `to` can be prefixed to any word in the
sentence to notate it as the subject/topic

```
xe existence

xe toko      : ko exists
xe toko ka   : ko is ka
xeqe toko ka : i am equal to ko

xepa toko    : ko did exist
xepa toko ka : ko was ka
xepa toko ka : i am equal to ko



```
