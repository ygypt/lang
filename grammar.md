## how to make thought

#### relationals
relationals are the basic blocks that turn
words into verbial sentences

there are 4 relationals:
+ existence
+ posession
+ causation
+ question

the relationals are listed in order of power,
with the first relational having the least power
and the final relational having the most. power
dictates how relationals interact with one another.
for instance if the relational of causation is
used in the same sentence as the relational of
existence, the relational of causation has affect
on the VERB OF EXISTENCE, and not on the objects
in the sentence. [bruh](http://google.com)

for these examples, i will be using placeholders
as the exact blocks havent been worked out

`ko, ka, ku, ke, ki` will all be nouns used for
exampling purposes

```
xe existence (x is y)

xeko          : ko exists
xeko ka       : ko is ka
```
```
sa has (x has y)

poke : ke is introduced
poke ka : ke has ka
poke ka ki : ke has ka and ki
poke xeko : ke has the action of ko existing ??
?? ke has the responsibility of ko's existence?
?? ke has the soul of ko?
?? ke has the equivalence of ko?
```
```
ca causation (x caused y)

causation doesnt affect nouns, it
affects the other two verbs

xeko caku    : ku caused ko to exist
xeko ka caku : ku caused ko to be ka

poke ka caku : ku caused ke to have ka
(aka ku gave ka to ke)
```

#### particles
particles are little blocks that go between
the verb and root that change how the verb
affects the sentence. an easy example is the
`negative` particle, which makes the verb mean
the opposite of its original meaning. for instance
`has.negative.noun1 noun2` would mean that `noun1`
DOESNT have `noun2`. here is a list of particles
and some more examples
```
no : negative
pa : past tense
fu : future tense
vo : volition
qe : equivalence
```
```
an example might be
xenoko : ko does not exist
sapako ka : ko used to have ka
safuko ka caku : ku will give ka to ko
```
volition is super important.
[MIGHT CHANGE] phrases are assumed
non-volitional unless tagged volitional

volition in causal verbs notates
that the causor intended the effect.
if john were to cause lisa to not exist
*non-volitionaly* (which is the default)
`exist.not.lisa cause.john`..,
that would mean he accidentally ended her
life. if john were to cause lisa to
not exist *volitionaly* `exist.not.lisa
cause.volition.lisa`.., that would mean
he sent that bich to the shadow realm

here are some more examples
```
xeko caku   : ku happens to make ko exist
xeko cavoku : ku makes ko exist intentionally

poko ka caku   : ku gives ka to ko (no intent)
poko ka cavoku : ku gives ka to ko (with intent)
