## how to make thought

#### relationals
relationals are the basic blocks that turn
words into verbial sentences

for these examples, i will be using placeholders
as the exact blocks havent beenworked out

`ko, ka, ku, ke, ki` will all be nouns used for
exampling purposes

```
xe existence (x is y)

xeko          : ko exists
xeko ka       : ko is ka
```
``
sa has (x has y)

sake ka : ke has ka
```
```
ca causation (x caused y)

causation doesnt affect nouns, it
affects the other two verbs

xeko caku    : ku caused ko to exist
xeko ka caku : ku caused ko to be ka

sake ka caku : ku caused ke to have ka
(aka ku gave ka to sake)
```

#### particles
particles are little blocks that go between
the verb and root that change how the verb
affects the sentence. an easy example is the
`negative` particle, which makes the verb mean
the opposite of its original meaning. for instance
`has.negative.noun1 noun2` would mean that `noun1`
DOESNT have `noun2`. here is a list of particles
and some more examples
```
no : negative
pa : past tense
fu : future tense
vo : volition
qe : equivalence
```
```
an example might be
xenoko : ko does not exist
sapako ka : ko used to have ka
safuko ka caku : ku will give ka to ko
```
volition is super important.
[MIGHT CHANGE] phrases are assumed
non-volitional unless tagged volitional

volition in causal verbs notates
that the causor intended the effect.
if john were to cause lisa to not exist
*non-volitionaly* (which is the default)
`exist.not.lisa cause.john`..,
that would mean he accidentally ended her
life. if john were to cause lisa to
not exist *volitionaly* `exist.not.lisa
cause.volition.lisa`.., that would mean
he sent that bich to the shadow realm

here are some more examples
```
xeko caku   : ku happens to make ko exist
xeko cavoku : ku makes ko exist intentionally

sako ka caku   : ku gives ka to ko (no intent)
sako ka cavoku : ku gives ka to ko (with intent)
