## how to make thought

##### relationals
relationals are the basic blocks that turn
words into verbial sentences

sentences are naturally first person but a topic
marker can be prefixed to any word in the sentence
to notate it as the subject/topic

```
xe existence
xe   : i exist
xeno : i dont exist
reqe xa   : i am equal to ko
repa xa   : i was ko
reqepa xa : i was equal to xa
re
```
