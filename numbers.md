## base 10 number system ;)

#### da numba chart
|place|block|-|value|block|
|---:|---|---|---|---|
|1     |`t'`|-|0|`k'`|
|10    |`to`|-|1|`ko`|
|100   |`ta`|-|2|`ka`|
|1000  |`tu`|-|3|`ku`|
|10000 |`te`|-|4|`ke`|
|100000|`ti`|-|5|`ki`|

#### how to use it
(i will be refering to decimal numbers as d#)

numbers are spoken as such

```{place.value}.{place.value}.{etc..```

for instance,

1 (d1) is `t'ko` or `ko`

5 (d5) is `t'ki` or `ki`

10 (d6) is `toko`

11 (d7) is `tokot'ko`

23 (d15) is `tokat'ku`

524 (d195) is `takitokat'ke`

##### to break that last one down

`{100.5}.{10.2}.{0.4}`
+ 5 in the 100th place
  + 2 in the 10th place
    + 4 in the 0th place

`{ta.ki}.{to.ka}.{t'.ke}`\
aka\
`taki.toka.t'ke`\
aka\
`takitokat'ke`

#### bigger numbers
rarely will you need numbers higher
than 100000 (d7776), but if you must,
you can make bigger numbers by combining
places like so:

`toti`\
aka `[10].[100000]`\
aka `10 Ã— 100000`\
aka `1,000000`

toti (1,000000) is equivalent to\
`10^10`\
aka `d6^d6`\
aka `d46656`

this allows you to create ludicrously high
numbers with very little effort. for instances
`totiti`, which is `1,000000,000000`
or `d2176782336`\
totiti is equivalent to `10^100` (`d6^d36`)
